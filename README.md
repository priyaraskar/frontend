<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/glyphicons-css@1.1.0/template.min.css" />
Include these in the <head> section of your HTML file, and the Bootstrap JS bundle before the closing </body> tag.

Customization
Icon Classes:

The accordion buttons use Glyphicons classes:

Default (closed): glyphicons glyphicons-plus-sign

Open state: glyphicons glyphicons-minus-sign

These classes can be adjusted if you want to use different icons from the Glyphicons library.

Color and Animation:

The CSS in this component controls all colors, animations, and layout properties. Feel free to customize:

Button background and text colors.

Icon transformation and rotation (using CSS transitions and cubic-bezier easing).

Content animations (open/close effects) defined in the keyframes.

Structure:

Modify or extend the accordion by adding more .accordion-item blocks. The structure follows Bootstrapâ€™s accordion guidelines.
